- sepolicy: Remove duplicate snxxx AIDL rules
 * These are now part of qcom/sepolicy_vndr.

- These are now part of qcom/sepolicy_vndr.
 * NfcNci and SecureElement are built by handheld_system.mk

- Implant bypass charging and address appropriate sepolicy rules
 * thanks @Rve27 for the kernel side work

- Resolving AxionOS Kernel Tuning/Performance Mode Denials and address SELinux denials for VM tuning
- Address more sepolicy 
 * Resolve mediacodec denials
 * Allow mdm_helper to use fowner capability
 * allow usbd binder call
 * Address schedtune denials
 * allow vendor_init to read fingerprint_data_file

- Moving some properties from vendor.prop to system.prop to make selinux happy 
 * ro.hwui.render_ahead
 * persist.mm.enable.prefetch
 * ro.config.avoid_gfx_accel
 * property=persist.radio.NO_STAPA
 * property=persist.radio.VT_HYBRID_ENABLE
 * persist.radio.dynamic_sar

- Move rild.libpath to system prop and set it manually
 * Nuked from init.qcom.rc

- Remove unexported property triggers from rootdir
- Resolve GNSS denial
- Tetheroffload: Version 1.1
- Build vendor.display.config@1.9
 * getTransport: Cannot find entry vendor.display.config@1.9::IDisplayConfig/default in either framework or device VINTF manifest.

   [ERROR][FORMAT ] camxdisplayconfig.cpp:124 Initialize() IDisplayConfig service is NULL, version 1.9

- Manually place msm_drm and msm_kgsl_3d0 IRQs
 * After unbalancing, move these IRQs to separate cores to improve latency.

- Set LTE+ threshold bandwidth to 0
 * so LTE+ icon will show whenever it's available

- Set 5G threshold bandwidth to 0
 * So that 5G+ icon will show whenever it's available

- Compact cached app heaps in the background
 * Background ART heap compaction for cached apps has been
   recommended for Android Go devices for a while, and Google has enabled it for
   the Pixel 5 on RQ1A.201205.010. This feature should help fit more cached apps
   in memory

- Rm package cache on early boot
 * Because Android won't do it on a dirty flash so certain elements will be broken if something is changed in UI.

- Disable turbulence noise
- Offload WM shell to another thread
 * Reduces jitter/jank when pulling down shade

- Disable debug.sf.latch_unsignaled
 *  debug.sf.latch_unsignaled - This causes SurfaceFlinger to latch   buffers
 even if their fences haven't signaled

 * Disabling this helps reduces notification QS lag, UI performance is not impacted.

  - Unicote:
    Also fixes live wallpapers lags

- Increase max fling velocity
 * Allow scrolling faster, corresponding to our reduced scroll friction.

- Give proper permissions for /dev/diag
 * This gives proper permission to /dev/diag node so that diag driver can load successfully

   Before in log:
   Diag_Lib:  Diag_LSM_Init: Failed to open handle to diag driver, error = 13

   After in log:
   Diag_Lib: qpLogDiagInit <== result : 1
   Diag_Lib: QMID : gIsQXDMDisabled 0, gIsADBDisabled 1, gIsDebugDisabled
   0, gIsIMSLogsDisabled 0

-  Silence some spammy logging
 * HWC and cit sensor logspam is so intense it bumps up logd's idle CPU
   usage up to over 3%. With this change, logs are much cleaner and logd
   idle CPU usage is reduced to under 1%, while still allowing error logs
   to pass through.
   - Do this only in user/debug builds (except eng).

- Disable Chimera.GmsIntentOperationService and Disable collective Device administrators GMS components
 * Inspired from universal gms doze magisk module.

- Disable adsprpcd_sensorspd.daemon
 * 69 spamming error in logs
